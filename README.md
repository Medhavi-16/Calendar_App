# Calendar_App
The app is a basic calendar app. You can select any date by tapping on the textview which displays the day and date or by tapping on any date on the calendar view. The arrows on either side of the month-year can be used to navigate to the next or previous month. After selecting the date you can add events on the date by pressing the add button on the bottom right of the screen. The view area below the title 'Events' shows the events that you have saved on that date. On long press of any event you will see the options of either deleting the event or updating it.
